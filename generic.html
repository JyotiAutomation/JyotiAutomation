									<p>I am from New Delhi, India. I will start with my academics, I did my bachelor’s in computer science in 2012<br />
									followed by master’s in computer science in 2015 from India. Immediately after graduating I was hired as a data analyst.<br />
									<br />
										<b>Why I choose data analyst over front end software engineer career?</b><br />
										During my masters I worked on a thesis which introduced me to the machine learning algorithms and finding optimal
										solutions to an already existing problem. <a href="https://research.ijcaonline.org/volume121/number17/pxc3904955.pdf">My thesis</a> was published in IJCA, International journal of Computer Applications
										in 2015. It was during this thesis I developed interest towards data science and hence decided to pursue my career in the world of data.	<br />
									<br />
										After 2.5 years of working as data analyst I wanted to learn, understand data science in and out and hence decided to pursue another master’s, this time in data analytics. I initially started with part-time courses
										at OHSU, Portland in data science and then later went full-time to Northeastern University and graduated in June 2020 with a GPA of 3.87.

									</p>I like hiking in the Pacific Northwest, its beautiful. I like camping and hearing horror stories around a campfire, i am a scaredy cat, but still cant stop myself.
										I like to canvas paint, it helps me relax. Road trips, a big yes for me. I am TV show binge watcher. Some of my favorite TV shows are The Office, That 70's show.
